This is what I have so far since this is time-boxed. I was able to parse the files and send the data to the client and render the results. However, I have not finished the "by rotation" part yet, and as you can see I have not added the styling yet. I am attaching a zipped directory of the project, and here are the instructions to see the current results (I plan to send you the updated/completed version a little later today).

1. clone repo, enter directory and run following commands:
2. > npm install
3. > webpack
3. > node build.js (this will parse the files and ready the data for the client)
4. > npm start (this will start the server)
5. Open localhost:8080 on your browser and see the results

...as mentioned, I think I can finish this assignment within the next hour so I will update this.
